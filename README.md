## About This Project

This project explores **heart disease prediction** using data analysis and machine learning techniques.  
It involves **data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, and building a **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** classifier to identify patterns associated with heart disease.

### Key Highlights
- Conducted thorough **EDA** to understand relationships between features such as age, cholesterol, and exercise-induced angina.  
- Implemented **feature selection** based on correlation and statistical analysis.  
- Built and optimized a **KNN model** using pipelines and cross-validation.  
- Achieved a **cross-validation accuracy of ~85%**, demonstrating good generalization and minimal overfitting.

### Tools and Libraries
- **Python**, **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, **Scikit-learn**

### Key Takeaway
Even though using all features didnâ€™t significantly improve accuracy, the selected subset of features effectively captured the key patterns for predicting heart disease â€” showcasing the importance of thoughtful feature selection.
